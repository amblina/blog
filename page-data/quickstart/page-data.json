For Windows and\nmacOS platforms follow the instructions at <a href=\"https://docs.docker.com/desktop/\">Docker\nDesktop</a> to install Docker. <em>Docker\ninstallations through Docker Toolbox are not supported. Please also be sure to\nselect the Hyper-V option during installation.</em> The EPI2ME Labs Launcher\napplication is available for these platforms from the <a href=\"https://community.nanoporetech.com/downloads\">Software\nDownloads</a> page on the Nanopore\nCommunity or the <a href=\"https://github.com/epi2me-labs/labslauncher/releases/latest\">GitHub\nrelease</a> page.\nPlease see also the Windows/MacOS Docker Install section below.</p>\n<h2>Installation</h2>\n<p>The EPI2ME Labs server runs in a\n<a href=\"https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container\">Docker</a> container in order to\nprovide an isolated and resettable environment. It can be controlled using the\nEPI2ME Labs launcher application. The instructions below will install both of\nthese tools onto your system</p>\n<h2>GridIon/PromethION Docker install</h2>\n<p>Docker is not currently installed by default on GridION devices. To install\ndocker follow the instructions below.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Click on the <strong>Search your computer</strong> button.</li>\n</ol>\n<h1>TODO: image</h1>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Search for “terminal”, and click on the Terminal application:</li>\n</ol>\n<h1>TODO: image</h1>\n<p>A terminal window will open:</p>\n<h1>TODO: image</h1>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Run the Docker installation command (you can copy and paste this into the\nterminal window and press <strong>Enter</strong>): <code class=\"language-text\">sudo apt update sudo apt install\ndocker.io sudo usermod -aG docker &lt;username&gt;</code> where <code class=\"language-text\">&lt;username&gt;</code> should be\nreplaced with your computer username.</li>\n<li>Close your terminal window.</li>\n<li>Log out of your GridION and log back in again.</li>\n<li>Open a new terminal window.</li>\n<li>To test docker is working correctly, run <code class=\"language-text\">docker run hello-world</code></li>\n</ol>\n<h1>TODO: image</h1>\n<h2>Windows and macOS Docker install</h2>\n<p>EPI2ME Labs is supported on Windows 10 Profession (and Enterprise) and macOS\nthrough <a href=\"https://docs.docker.com/desktop/\">Docker Desktop</a>. Use of Docker\nDesktop on Windows 10 Home through the use of Windows Subsytem for Linux 2\n(WSL2) is untested. For the most part, users should simply follow the\ninstallation instructions for their system on the Docker website.</p>\n<h3>Data shares</h3>\n<p>During installation users may be asked to allow Docker access to parts of their\nfile system; users should grant access to any locations where data resides they\nwish to analyse with EPI2ME Labs. In particular users are likely to want to add\nthe MinKNOW output directory as a share in Docker.</p>\n<p>It is possible to allow data shares to Docker after installation by opening the\nDocker Desktop program and navigating to its settings page:</p>\n<h1>TODO: image</h1>\n<p>On Windows 10 it may be possible to avoid having to add folders manually in the\nDocker Desktop program by checking that application notifications are enabled\nin the system Settings:</p>\n<h1>TODO: image</h1>\n<p>With notifications enabled, users may see pop-ups like the following when\nrunning the EPI2ME Labs launcher; users should click “Share it” in these\ninstances.</p>\n<h3>Resource Limits</h3>\n<p>By default Docker Desktop sets fairly conservative resource limits for itself,\nyou may wish to change these in the Docker Desktop settings pane. We recommend\nsetting the Memory limit to at least 8Gb (some EPI2ME Labs tutorials may\nrequire more as indicated in their introductions) and the CPUs to one or two\nless than the maximum value for your system.</p>\n<h1>TODO: image</h1>\n<h2>Install the EPI2ME Labs launcher application</h2>\n<p>The EPI2ME Labs launcher application provides a convenient way to start, stop,\nand update the EPI2ME Labs notebook server. The source code for the application\nis available in our GitHub\n<a href=\"https://github.com/epi2me-labs/labslauncher\">repository</a></p>\n<h3>Installing the Launcher on GridION and PromethION</h3>\n<p>The EPI2MELabs Launcher is most easily installed:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Copy and paste the following into the terminal window and press <strong>Enter</strong>:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">sudo apt update\nsudo apt install ont-epi2melabs-launcher</code></pre></div>\n</li>\n<li>Click on the Search your computer icon, and search for “EPI2ME”. Then click\non the <strong>EPI2ME-Labs Server Control</strong> icon. This will start the launcher.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Installing the Launcher on Windows 10 and macOS</h3>\n<p>We provide a Windows 10 installer and an macOS Application bundle on the\n<a href=\"/blog/downloads\">Downloads</a> page. Simply download and run these files to install\nthe EPI2MELabs Launcher on these platforms.</p>\n<h2>Start EPI2ME Labs from the launcher</h2>\n<p>The EPI2ME Labs launcher interface has all the functionality required for users\nto manage the EPI2ME Labs notebook server.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>To start a notebook server click the <strong>Start</strong> button to reach the <strong>Start\nServer</strong> screen:</li>\n</ol>\n<h1>TODO: image</h1>\n<p>There are three options on the Start Server page:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Select path:</strong> the location on your computer which you want to be visible\nwithin the notebooks</li>\n<li><strong>token:</strong> a security token (password) to allow access to the notebook\ninterface</li>\n<li><strong>port:</strong> network port to access the notebook server interface</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>TODO: image</h1>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>The data location is pre-filled with a default data path. To select a\ndifferent folder, click <strong>Select path</strong> to show the selection dialog:</li>\n</ol>\n<h1>TODO: image</h1>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Navigate the directory tree until the dialog is within your selected folder,\nthen click <strong>Open</strong>.</li>\n<li>We strongly encourage updating the token to a unique value. The token\nprovides an authentication method that allows only trusted users access to the\nEPI2ME Labs server and is used as an additional security layer to help prevent\nother users on the network from running code and accessing data. This token\nwill be used later in the workflow to connect Google Colaboratory to the\nserver.</li>\n<li>Click <strong>Start</strong> on the main screen to start the notebook server.</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>The first time a server is started the server components must be\ndownloaded. This will not happen on subsequent server starts.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>When the server has successfully launched, there will be a message at the\nbottom of the launcher interface stating “Server status: running.“:</p>\n<h1>TODO: image</h1>\n<h3>Updating the server</h3>\n<p>The EPI2ME Labs launcher application automatically detects when updates are\navailable to the notebok server. Oxford Nanopore Technologies’ may\noccassionally provide updates to provide new features or improved performance.</p>\n<p>When an update is available attempting to start or restart the notebook server\nwhen an update is available will result in the following being displayed:</p>\n<h1>TODO: image</h1>\n<ol>\n<li>To update the server, press the <strong>Update</strong> button on the main screen.
