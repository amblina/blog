Our GitHub repository contains a growing\ncollection of notebooks on a range of topics from basic quality control to\ngenome assembly. These are free and open to use by anyone.</p>\n<p>EPI2ME Labs extends the JupyterLab notebook framework with a pre-configured\nanalysis server. The notebooks display Python code needed to run data analysis,\nhowever zero configuration of the code is required. Because of this, the\nnotebooks can be used both by <strong>students</strong> and <strong>researchers</strong> new to nanopore\nsequence data analysis, and more experienced bioinformaticians who are\ncomfortable working with Python.</p>\n<p>The EPI2ME Labs server runs in a <a href=\"https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container\">Docker\ncontainer</a> to provide an\nisolated and resettable environment.</p>\n<h2>Setting up EPI2ME Labs</h2>\n<p>EPI2ME Labs notebooks are supported on the GridION Mk1 sequencing platform as\nwell as any Windows 10, macOS, or Linux desktop. All components are also\nreleased open-source in our <a href=\"https://github.com/epi2me-labs\">GitHub</a>\nrepository.</p>\n<p><strong><em>System requirements for running EPI2ME Labs:</em></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Compute requirements: the amount of compute needed for each type of analysis\nis specified in each EPI2ME Labs tutorial.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><em>Installation quick start</em></strong>:</p>\n<p>Our <a href=\"/blog/quickstart\">Quick Start guide</a> will help you to get started running a\nnotebook server and web-based analyses.</p>\n<h2>Available notebooks</h2>\n<p>A complete list of available notebooks can be found by clicking <strong>File</strong>, then\n<strong>Open notebook</strong> at the top of this page and then clicking on the GitHub tab.\nEnter <strong>epi2me-labs</strong> in the textbox, and make sure the respository\n<code class=\"language-text\">epi2me-labs/tutorials</code> is selected.</p>\n<p>Alternatively visit our <a href=\"/blog/nbindex\">Index of Notebooks</a> page to see a complete\nlisting with descriptions.</p>\n<h2>Using notebooks</h2>\n<p>In their basic form, notebooks provide a platform for running data analysis\ncode and plotting graphs. </p>\n<p>Notebooks allow the combination of executable code, rich text, images, HTML,\nLaTeX and more into a single document enabling the creation of an easy to\nfollow set of instructions to analyse your data. By extending Googleâ€™s Colab\nenvironment you can create your own notebooks, and store them in your Google\nDrive account. You can easily share your notebooks with others, allowing them\nto comment on your notebooks or even edit them.
