# EPI2MELabs downloads and resources

Below are listed all resources on which EPI2MELabs is built. We aim for all
components of EPI2MELabs to be open source (including this website!).
If you find something is not available please contact support@nanoporetech.com


## EPI2MELabs Launcher

The LabsLauncher is used to start, stop, and update the EPI2MELabs notebook
server. We provide executables for Windows 10, macOS, and Linux.

#TODO: add download links

The launcher is written in Python with [Qt](https://www.qt.io/) and the
sourcecode is available from GitHub:
https://github.com/epi2me-labs/labslauncher.


## Notebook files

*A listing of all available notebooks is available on the [Notebook
Index](/nbindex) page.*

The notebooks used within EPI2MELabs are available in their source form from
the GitHub repository: https://github.com/epi2me-labs/notebooks. These are
updated regularly with enhancements and fixes.

## Docker containers

The docker container for the EPI2MELabs notebook server is hosted on dockerhub:
https://hub.docker.com/r/ontresearch/nanolabs-notebook
